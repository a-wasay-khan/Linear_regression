### **Linear Regression Calorie Predictor**  
The **Linear Regression Calorie Predictor** is a project designed to predict **calorie burn** based on a person's **average pulse rate**. Using data from a CSV file, the model applies **linear regression** through the **`scipy.stats.linregress`** function to find the relationship between pulse rate and calorie burn. Key metrics such as the **slope**, **intercept**, **R-squared value**, **p-value**, and **standard error** are calculated to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and statistical significance. The results are visualized with a **fitted regression line** using **matplotlib**, providing clear insights into how pulse rate influences calorie expenditure. This model can be used in fitness and health applications to estimate calorie burn based on heart rate data.
